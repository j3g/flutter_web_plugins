## How to use

Add `ProgressButton` to your widget tree:

    progressWidget: const CircularProgressIndicator(),
    width: 196,
    height: 40,
    onPressed: () async {
        int score = await Future.delayed(
            const Duration(milliseconds: 3000), () => 42);
        // After [onPressed], it will trigger animation running backwards, from end to beginning
        return () {
        // Optional returns is returning a VoidCallback that will be called
        // after the animation is stopped at the beginning.
        // A best practice would be to do time-consuming task in [onPressed],
        // and do page navigation in the returned VoidCallback.
        // So that user won't missed out the reverse animation.
        };
